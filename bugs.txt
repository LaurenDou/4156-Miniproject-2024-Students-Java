Course Class

enrolledStudent count set from 500 to 0
getCourseLocation returns courseLocation var
getInstructorName returns instructorName var
isCourseFull() returns false when course is full



Department Class
Number of majors ranged from negative to not negative
got rid of quotes
dropPersonFromMajor function changed so only decreases number of majors if numberOfMajors is greater than 0
"result.toString()" removed quotes


RouteController
if department not found returns not found error code. If department found returns ok error code
retrieveCourse returns HttpStatus.OK instead of forbidden as per the comment at the top
getMajorCountFromDept HttpStatus.FORBIDDEN changed to not found to align with other functions
-departmentMapping.get(deptCode) changed to positive value
findCourseLocation dept code capitalization doesn't matter
findCourseLocation updated so return value is more comprehensive
made all methods that take a deptCode not be case sensitive to maintain consistency
