https://sachinsf.com/how-to-use-pmd-code-analyzer-with-intellij/

1. Download PMD
2. Download PMD plugin in IntelliJ
3. Settings -> Tools -> External Tools
4. Create New
   5. Name can be anything
   6. Description can be anything
   7. Program enter the PMD.bat file that you downloaded form the pmd website that was given in the course
   8. Arguments put this in

11. Go Into Settings > PMD (not in any category)
12. Add a Ruleset of the one I used ( in 4156-Miniproject-2024-Students-Java/IndividualProject/001-maven-pmd-plugin-default.xml)
    12. Note: This ruleset is just the one taken from https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-pmd-plugin/examples/usingRuleSets.html (default ruleset)
    12. The only difference is that I removed TooManyStaticImports because I believe that that is just a stylistic choice and I want all of the individual imports
