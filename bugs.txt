Number of majors ranged from negative to not negative

retrieveCourse deptCode now accepts all dept codes regardless of capitalization to be aligned with functionality of retrieveDepartment
retrieveCourse returns HttpStatus.OK instead of forbidden as per the comment at the top
isCourseFull dept code now accepts all dept code

/getMajorCountFromDept
getMajorCountFromDept HttpStatus.FORBIDDEN changed to not found to align with other functions

findCourseLocation dept code capitalization doesn't matter
